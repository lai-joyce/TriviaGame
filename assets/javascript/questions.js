			question : "On an early morning run near his home, a runner startled a group of dogs beingexercised and was bitten on the leg. The runner was later unable to locate the dog and itsowner to verify that the dog had an up-to-date rabies vaccination. Given that rabies isalways fatal, and despite the very low incidence in domesticated dogs, prudence dictatedundergoing treatment. The runner was given human immunoglobulin G-containing antibodies to rabies virus (anti-rabies immunoglobulin) injected around the site of thewound and at several other intramuscular sites. This antibody preparation confers instantprotection from the virus without requiring the body to develop a response. This is an example of:",
